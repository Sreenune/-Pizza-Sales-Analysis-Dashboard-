# -Pizza-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard : 🚀 Excited to share my latest Power BI project: Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard! 🍕📊

I recently completed an end-to-end business intelligence project where I designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze a pizza restaurant’s sales performance over the course of a year.
This Power BI project analyzes pizza sales performance, highlighting key metrics like total sales, orders, and top-selling pizzas. Using DAX and Power Query, I created an interactive dashboard showcasing trends, peak hours, and product performance to drive business insights and strategic decision-making.

📈 Key Metrics and Insights:

✅ Total Sales: $817.86K
✅ Total Orders: 21K
✅ Total Pizzas Sold: 49K
✅ Average Order Value: $38.31
✅ Average Orders per Day: 60

🔹 Best Month: July — Achieved peak performance with 1,935 orders and $72K in sales.
🔹 Busiest Days: Thursday and Friday — Higher customer traffic observed toward the weekend, ideal for targeted promotions.
🔹 Peak Hours: 12 PM to 3 PM — Lunchtime contributed the highest order volume, perfect for special meal deals.
🔹 Top-Selling Pizza: Thai Chicken Pizza — Generated $43K in sales, a clear customer favorite.
🔹 Lowest-Selling Pizza: Brie Carre Pizza — Recorded the least sales at $11.5K, presenting opportunities for optimization.
🔹 Top-Selling Category: Classic Pizzas — Led the categories with 14,888 pizzas sold.
🔹 Most Preferred Size: Large — Accounted for 36.4% of total sales volume.
🔹 Best Quarter: Q2 — Delivered the highest revenue of $208.37K.
